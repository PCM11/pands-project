# pands-project

The minimum standard is a GitHub repository containing a README, a Python script, a
generated summary text file, and images. The README (and/or notebook) should contain a 
summary of the data set and your investigations into it. It should also clearly document how 
to run the Python code and what that code does. Furthermore, it should list all references 
used in completing the project. 
A better project will be well organised and contain detailed explanations. The analysis will 
be well conceived, and examples of interesting analyses that others have pursued based on 
the data set will be discussed. Note that the point of this project is to use Python. You may 
use any Python libraries that you wish, whether they have been discussed in class or not. 
You should not be thinking of using spreadsheet software like Excel to do your calculations.
