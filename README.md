## About this Project

The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset to understand classification and clustering algorithms in machine learning and statistics, made famous by Ronald Fisher.
It cosists of 150 samples, 50 from each of the the 3 species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris versicolor). Each sample includes the measurements of sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length.

## How to get started.

To further explore this dataset you need to download python, which can be installed through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download),and notebook editor, which can be found in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Analysis

 I imported Python libraries to anlyse the data.

- Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis. It allows us to investigate CSV files, amongst other features.

- Matplotlib - for data visualisation and graphical plotting

- Seaborn - built on top of matplotlib with similar functionalities

- Numpy - to perform  wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays
